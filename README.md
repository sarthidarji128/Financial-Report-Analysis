# Financial Report Analysis

This Python project calculates and visualizes key financial ratios for a sample company across multiple years. The project aims to provide insights into the profitability and leverage of the company. Specifically, it computes the following financial ratios:

- **Leverage Ratio**: The ratio of total assets to net profit.
- **Profit Margin**: The percentage of revenue that turns into profit.
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: The percentage of profit generated from total assets.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: The percentage of profit generated from revenue.

These financial ratios are calculated and visualized in the form of line plots for each year in the sample dataset.

## Project Overview
